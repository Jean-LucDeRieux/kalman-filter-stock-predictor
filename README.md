## Kalman Stock Prediction
This work is based off of this paper "Kalman Filtering for Stocks Price Prediction and Control" from Journal of Computer Science.

It utilizes a Kalman Filter to filter stock prices. I took it further and implmented code to allow for future predictions. I found that it can predict basic trends pretty well.
